        Product sourcing is one of the main tasks that web designers will be involved in, whether they work freelance or for an agency or company. Product sourcing includes finding new products, negotiating prices with suppliers, placing orders, and following up on delivery timescales. <br>
        Product sourcing is the process of finding a vendor or manufacturer who can provide a product or service to complete an order. Product sourcing is often done by an individual, but it may also be conducted by a company or organization. <br>
        The global product-sourcing industry has been experiencing rapid growth in recent years and is expected to continue doing so in the future. The industry is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.9% from 2018-2023, reaching $1 trillion in value by 2023. <br>
        Product sourcing and procurement are part of the same broader category called supply chain management and both are used interchangeably in many contexts. The difference between them is that product sourcing focuses on finding suppliers for products, while procurement focuses on buying products from suppliers. <br>
        We also source products, especially for the oil and gas industry sector as we have experienced hand from these products, apart from these products we affiliate products by providing brief information about the product to educate our readers to choose their products.
