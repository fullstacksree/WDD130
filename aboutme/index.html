    <p><h2><b>Sree Ranganath Koonisetti</p></b></h2></p>
    <p><br>I want to introduce myself to all of you, people who know me call as Sree and I am living in Visakhapatnam, India.  I married my life and eternal companion, and we have a child who is eagerly waiting for his mission call. <br>

      <br>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Technology, as I am more passionate about web designing and development, graphic designing, and android app designing. Currently, working as an HR at Patra Corporation, Visakhapatnam, and want to change my career as the future is in technology.<br>

      <br>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints since 2015, and from then I have served in different callings.<br>

      <br>I am interested in reading, traveling, so that I can make new friends around the world and to know their culture. <br> 
      
      <br>I love BYU because it gives me an opportunity to educate myself for better life and to share the knowledge to others which I have learned, so that I can support who are in need to educate themselves for better future.<br>
      
      <br>Thank you very much for the opportunity through this page.</p>
